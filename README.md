### Running the System
Run the main.py file to start the system. All packages will be installed if not already. The corpus will then be formatted correctly in the jsonl format.
The indexing will then start. Once complete, a search query can be entered and the top 50 results will be returned. It will contain a doc ID, the score, the title,
and a snippet containing one or more terms from the query, for each result returned. Multiple queries can be entered, or a blank query can be entered to end the program.
